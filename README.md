## Disclaimer: 
None of the cryptographic operations implemented here should be used to secure anything even remotely sensitive.
Please use established libraries (GPG, NaCl, NSS, GnuTLS, OpenSSL, etc.) for those purposes. No guarantees can be made about this code's completeness or suitability for any particular purpose.

That being said, I think there is much fun and interesting learning to be had by implementing some of the crytographic operations we use every day.
Feel free to use, copy, alter and distribute any or all of the code here with or without attribution.
